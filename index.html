    <h2>About me<h2>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>I graduated high school in the year 2020. I joined Moringa School in 2021 where i pursue Software Development. I chose Soflwate Development for three reasons: I wanted to gain knowledge and skills in coding and apply them in future life. High market demand for Software Development skills also serves as a guarantee for a job once i complete the course. Lastly I prefer doing remote work since it's very flexible.</p>
    
    <h4>Interests, Hobbies and Skills.</h4>
    <p>I have an interest in learning all the fundamental skills required in software development moreso soft skills such as <em>problem solving, teamwork</em> and <em>effective communication</em>.</p>
